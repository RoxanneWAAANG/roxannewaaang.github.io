# About Me

**Hello, I'm Ruoxin (Roxanne) Wang!**

I'm a graduate student studing Artificial Intelligence at Duke University. I earned my Bachelor of Science degree from Hong Kong Baptist University major in Data Science. I am deeply passionate about doing research on language models and multi-modal models by exploring mathematical theories behind them.
## Who I Am

- **Background:** I was born in Jinan, Shandong Province, China and have always been fascinated by data and mathematics. My academic and professional path has led me to explore Artificial Intelligence (AI), shaping my unique perspective.
- **Professional Experience:** With over 5 years of experience in AI, I've had the opportunity to work on projects like brain tumor segmentations, medical agent development.
- **Personal Interests:** Outside of work, I'm passionate about dancing, hiking and piano. I love nature-related activities for a little nature inspired debugging!

## My Journey & Mission

Throughout my internship experiences in AI, I realized that it is more critical to explore the interpretability of AI models, improving the computational effenciency based on mathematical theories rather than stacking up complex technologies. Today, I strive to conduct research in multimodal and NLP field. I believe in 'Turning words into wisdom – one algorithm at a time'.

## Let's Connect

I aspire to pursue a PhD in AI, contributing to the future of multi-modal intelligence and responsible AI research. If you are also passionate about these fields, let’s connect!
